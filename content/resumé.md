Software engineer with 8 years of industry experience with focus on test and
devops tech stacks. I am deeply interested in cloud infrastructure, large scale
systems, and application development for cloud architectures. I have experience
in a diverse set of techonologies and have solved problems in various areas
including development, testing, scalability and operations. I’m currently
looking for (remote) opportunities in the tech spaces that interest me.

# Experience

### Test and Tools Engineer
_Qubole, Big Data as a Service  (Dec 2013-Feb 2017)_


At Qubole, I laid the foundations of the testing team and acted as tech lead
and individual contributor. I’ve contributed extensively in the test, tools and
devops nature of the platform. My profiency lies in creating long term designs
and taking timely decisions to evolve the testing process to deliver a great
platform at a lightning pace. In my IC role, I’ve been involved in development
of build tools, deploy tools, continuous integration and test frameworks. As a
mentor I’ve managed a small team of 5 test engineers, helped documentation
efforts, release management and a bit of product management as well.

### Senior Software Engineer
_Citrix Systems/Apache CloudStack/Cloud.com  (Dec 2010-Dec 2013)_

At cloud.com I engineered and laid the foundations for the testing of Apache
CloudStack. I’ve done everything from developing custom test frameworks to
innovative patent-worthy approaches for testing large scale infrastructure
systems. For the Apache CloudStack project I helped setup the public facing
automatic test infrastructure that runs several complex integration tests on an
automatically deployed live system. The system is a critical stability
indicator of releases at Apache CloudStack. At Citrix and in the Apache
community I’ve also mentored engineers (experienced and rookie) in software
engineering practices and technology adoption.

### Software Engineer
_S&P Capital IQ, McGraw Hill Financial (Jun 2008-Dec 2010)_

At Capital IQ, I developed various text munching algorithms and techniques to
dig out Financial data available on the public domain with the SEC. This
involved a custom pattern-matching tool used in production today to work
through thousands of SEC filings and automatically gathering data and meaning.
All work was done in .NET and large datasets found in SQL database systems.

# Education

### BS in Computer Science 
_IIIT-Hyderabad_
*(2004-2008)*

At the IIIT-H, I developed a strong foundation in theory combined with
application of Computer Science. Rigourous courses served to strengthen my core
computer science skills. I had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of
topics and problems with some very talented individuals. My most interesting
experience was in developing a low-cost caching algorithm deployed on the
low-bandwidth networks of any typical university proxy environments.
