# Experience

### Test and Tools Engineer
_Qubole, Big Data as a Service  (Dec 2013-Feb 2017)_

At Qubole, I've worked extensively on the web platform, tools and devops nature
of the platform. My proficiency lies in creating long term designs and taking
timely decisions to evolve the platform quickly. I've also been involved in
development of build tools, deploy tools, continuous integration and test
frameworks. As a mentor I've managed a small team of engineers, helped
documentation efforts, release management and a bit of product management as
well.


### Senior Software Engineer
_Citrix Systems/Apache CloudStack/Cloud.com  (Dec 2010-Dec 2013)_

At cloud.com I worked on Apache CloudStack. To help speed up the developer
cycle I developed the Simulator hypervisor which later went into building
Marvin - the integration test framework. For the Apache CloudStack project I
helped setup the public facing infrastructure that runs several complex
integration tests on an automatically deployed live system. The system is a
critical stability indicator of releases at Apache CloudStack. 

### Software Engineer
_S&P Capital IQ, McGraw Hill Financial (Jun 2008-Dec 2010)_

At Capital IQ, I developed various text munching algorithms and techniques to
dig out Financial data available on the public domain with the SEC. This
involved a custom pattern-matching tool used in production today to work
through thousands of SEC filings and automatically gathering data and meaning.
All work was done in .NET and large datasets found in SQL database systems.
