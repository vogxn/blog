Cost benefit analysis shows - benefits outweigh the total expenditure on infrastructure



Interesting case because why was UIDAI not accepting the request. Is storage
raw fingerprint or private template?

Interesting also that SC denied this and forced that Aadhar holder needed to provide access?

```
In 2013 Goa, the CBI was trying to solve the case of a rape of a schoolgirl. It
approached a Goa local court saying that they had acquired some fingerprints
from the scene and they could be matched with the UIDAI database. The court
asked UIDAI to hand over all data of all persons in Goa to CBI.[122][123]
The UIDAI appealed in the Bombay High Court saying that accepting such a
request would set precedent for several more such requests. The High Court
rejected the argument and on 26 February 2014 in an interim order directed
Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) to study technological capability of
the database to see if it can solve such a crime. The UIDAI then appealed in
the Supreme Court. It argued that the chance of a false positive was 0.057% and
with 600 million people in its database it would result in hundreds of
thousands of false results

At service
-----------

Laws are unclear on who can/cannot request the Aadhar Number. Can services be
denied by private/public if other identity is proven?


Interesting that individual has option to not give consent that UIDAI allows access to public agencies
