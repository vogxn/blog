Greetings - I'm a software developer based in [Bangalore,
India](https://en.wikipedia.org/Bangalore). Many years ago I wrote blogs while
going through college at the [IIIT-H](https://www.iiit.ac.in). As life took
over and the dayjob paid the bills, I lost touch with blogging. Back then
blogging was a big deal and I used to read the ilks of
[Meghalomania](https://twitter.com/meghalomania) and [Krish
Ashok](https://krishashok.me/). Facebook and Twitter soon killed away the gusto
of bloggers but given the vitriolic atmosphere of these platforms
long-form makes a lot more sense now. It's the return of the bloggers! 

This blog is meant to express my thoughts about
[software](https://github.com/vogxn), politics, india,
[photography](https://instagram.com/vogxn),
[music](https://soundcloud.com/vogonjeltz8423/), cooking, gardening,
[people-being-wrong-on-the-internet](https://xkcd.com/386/) and so on.
